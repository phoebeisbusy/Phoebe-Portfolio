## 🔥 Research Interests
- Gut microbiota & cardiomyopathy
- Machine learning in microbiome analysis
- Probiotic interventions for disease prevention
- Bioinformatics & multi-omics integration

## 🚀 Featured Projects
### **1. Gut Microbiota Ecology and Composition Analysis**  
- Processed large-scale NGS datasets using **DADA2** and **phyloseq** in R  
- Visualized beta diversity via **PCoA** and identified significant shift via **PERMENOVA** analysis
- Performed **differential abundance analysis** using **DESeq2** to identify taxa enriched in disease states 

### **2. Predicting Microbiome-Disease Interactions with Machine Learning**
- Developed **LASSO regression** models to identify central taxa linked to cardiomyopathy severity 
- Integrated host metadata to assess correlations with disease phenotypes  

### **3. Strain-Level Characterization of *Lactobacillus***  
- Assembled whole genomes of *L. reuteri* strains using **SPAdes** and annotated them with **Prokka**  
- Identified orthologous genes using **BLAST** and **HMMER**, followed by multiple sequence alignment with **MAFFT**  
- Reconstructed phylogenetic relationships using **FastTree**, with interactive tree visualization in **iTOL**  
- Automated genome analysis pipeline using **Nextflow**, **Bash**, and **Python** for reproducibility
